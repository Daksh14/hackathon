- Problem Solution Summary: 
    - A electron web app that will track where you go, what you spend your money on, what you did for fun, searched online and more for the week/month/year and then display it to you in some meaningfull way. For instance help you break a bad habit of drinking too much coffee and spending $10 a day at starbucks simotaneously. We want the app to not discriminate, but give helpfull advice and resources. It should also be interactive and unique to keep a client engaged and bettering their lives. We also plan to have a leader board / mental health rating system of some kind.

- What did you learn?

## Badges
üèÜ


Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

- None

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
