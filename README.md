- Problem Solution Summary: 
    - We intend to develop an electron web app that has the capability of monitoring particularly significant aspects of your life, for example, What you do for fun, your browser history, How you spend your money, Where you go and other key metrics that will allow the app to identify users bad-habits and provide useful and relative advice and resources to help themselves break these habits.
    - We wish for this application to be non-discriminatory and non-judgemental in a capacity where it is still capable of providing the advice and resources without offending the user. We intend to build a fruitful application that will be highly-interactive and unique to keep the user engaged and ensure a betterment in their lives. To ensure this frequent and active engagement we have discussed the possibility of an integrated leader-board feature.

## Badges
üèÜ


Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

- None

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
